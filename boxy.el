;;; Commentary:

;;   Boxy provides an interface to create a 3D representation of
;;   boxes.  Each box has a relationship with one other box.  Multiple
;;   boxes can be related to one box.  The relationship can be any of
;;   the following:
;;
;;   - in
;;   - on
;;   - behind
;;   - on top of
;;   - in front of
;;   - above
;;   - below
;;   - to the right of
;;   - to the left of
;;
;;   The relationship determines the ordering and structure of the
;;   resulting boxy diagram.
;;
;;   Only boxes which have their :name slot set will be drawn to the
;;   buffer.  Boxes without names still take up space and can have
;;   children, so can be used for grouping.  All diagrams have one top
;;   level unnamed box called a `world'.
;;
;;   Each box should have either a list of markers or an action
;;   function.  When viewing a box that has a list of markers, the
;;   following keybindings are available:
;;
;;   RET/mouse-1   - Jump to the first marker
;;   o             - Open next marker in other window.
;;                     Pressed multiple times, cycle through markers.
;;   M-RET         - Open all markers as separate buffers.
;;                     This will split the current window as needed.
;;
;;   When viewing a box with an action function, RET and <mouse-1>
;;   will be bound to that function.
;;
;;   Additionally, all boxes have the following keybindings defined:
;;
;;   r     - Jump to the box directly related to the current box.
;;             Repeated presses will eventually take you to the
;;             top level box.
;;   TAB   - Cycle visibility of box's children
;;
;;   See the class definition for `boxy-box' for all other available
;;   properties.
;;
;;   To start, create an empty box named `world'.
;;
;;     (let ((world (boxy-box)))
;;
;;   Use the method `boxy-add-next' to add top-level boxes to the
;;   world, without relationships:
;;
;;     (let ((cyprus (boxy-box :name "Cyprus"))
;;           (greece (boxy-box :name "Greece")))
;;       (boxy-add-next cyprus world)
;;       (boxy-add-next greece world)
;;
;;   To ease the boxy renderer, use the :expand-siblings and
;;   :expand-children slots.  These should be list of functions which
;;   take the current box as an argument and call `boxy-add-next' to
;;   add sibling boxes and children boxes respectively.  Children
;;   boxes are defined as any box with a relationship of in, on,
;;   behind, in front of, or on top of.  Sibling boxes are defined as
;;   any box with a relationship of above, below, to the left of, or
;;   to the right of.
;;
;;      (object-add-to-list cyprus :expand-siblings
;;                          '(lambda (box)
;;                             (boxy-add-next
;;                              (boxy-box :name "Lebanon" :rel "below")
;;                              box)))
;;
;;   The expansion slots will be called when the user toggles the
;;   box's visibility.
;;
;;   To display a box in a popup buffer, use the function `boxy-pp'.
;;
;;   The methods `boxy-merge' and `boxy-merge-into' should be
;;   used to merge boxes together.  `boxy-merge' takes a list of
;;   boxes and merges them into one box.  `boxy-merge-into' takes
;;   two boxes and merges the first into the second.
